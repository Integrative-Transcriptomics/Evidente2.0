# Evidente 2.0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

The project is running with the following requirements. Lower versions might work, but are not tested

- Node: v16.13.0
- npm: 8.1.3
- python: 3.7.4
- java: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 14.0.1+7)

## Run Devolpment Version

1. Go to project folder
2. Run setup.sh to install all npm and python packages
   `bash setup.sh`
3. Activate virtual environment
   `source env/bin/activate`
4. Run development version of evidente
   `npm run evidente`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Run Deployment Version

1. Go to project folder
2. Create virtual environment
   `python3 -m venv env`
3. Activate virtual environment
   `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install python dependencies
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install server package (setup.py)
   `pip install .`
6. Install npm packages
   `npm install`
7. Build deployment version of code
   `npm run build`
8. Run server
   `npm run server`
9. Access deployed version at http://localhost:5000/

## Available Examples

<!-- ### Toy Example

Toy example with 38 taxa and 10 SNPs. The phylogenetic tree is a modified version of the one presented by Yokoyama et al (2008, [Publication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18768804)). The SNPs are based on the table of the _Mycobacterim leprae_ by Schuenemann et al (2018, [Publication](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006997)). Hence, this example does not show any biological data, but it can still be used to get to know the GUI of Evidente. -->

### Mini Example

Extract of the Toy Example with seven taxa. This example is used to initialize Evidente.

### _Mycobacterium leprae_

From Schuenemann et al (2018, [Publication](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006997)). The study analyzed over 169 taxa of different species around the globe and identified 3155 SNPs. It provides a metadata file with the location and date of extraction of the samples.

### _Treponema pallidum_

From Arora et al (2016, [Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016245)). The study analyzed around 120 samples of different strains of the
_T. pallidum_ collected around the globe. It analyzed their antibiotic resistance and it was able to identified a correlation between the presence of SNP 235204 and a resistance to the antibiotic macrolide.
